ðŸ“œ Blogify - A Modern Blogging Platform

ðŸš€ Fast | Secure | Scalable


ðŸŒŸ Introduction
I Named the app blogify but it is my first big public app, while on bootcamp with @hiteshChoudhary, full-stack blogging platform built with React Vite, powered by Appwrite for backend services. It provides a seamless experience for bloggers to create, edit, and manage articles with ease. The app features state management with Redux, routing with React Router, and form validation using Formik.
